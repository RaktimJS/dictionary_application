## About Me

Hi, my name is Raktim, and I'm a senior high school student from a Tier 3 town named Pathsala, in the state of Assam, India.

I'm very passionate about Computers and Mathematics, and I enjoy building systems that integrate Math with Computer Programming. As this program is the kind of project I enjoy working on the most, building it solo was a lot of fun!

___

This app is built completely using Python and utilizes almost every Python concept from the 11th grade CBSE Computer Science syllabus (and very few concepts from 12th grade Computer Science).

___

## How was this made?

1. The app is written entirely in Python and is split into two files:  
   - `interface.py` (the main entry point)  
   - `module.py` (contains all the dictionary-based operations)
2. Uses dictionaries extensively to demonstrate key-value manipulation, search, and editing.
3. Features include:
   - Key guessing game
   - Dictionary-based square generator
   - Character frequency counter
   - List editing within dictionaries
   - Fetching keys with min/max values
4. Makes use of abstracted random list/dict generators to support randomized data handling.
5. Designed with CLI-friendly formatting, user input validation, and simple UX flows.

___

## What were the learnings?

1. Got hands-on experience with dictionary operations: searching, updating, looping, and nesting.
2. Practiced randomization, abstraction, and clean function design for reusability.
3. Worked on building logical UI patterns for user-driven selection and termination.
4. Reinforced the value of modularizing functionality for maintainability and clarity.
5. Improved CLI presentation using ANSI codes and real-time feedback via loops and input parsing.

## How to run the program?

- Make sure Python is installed and added to your system path.
- Open a terminal in the project directory.
- Run the file: `interface.py`

## Final note

Please drop a mail with your feedback.  
**Iâ€™d genuinely love it if anyone checking this project could share their thoughts.**

Any kind of suggestions - concept improvements, code structuring, or feature ideas - are always welcome!
